[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wrozka/capybara-angular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wrozka/capybara-angular)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/capybara-angular.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/capybara-angular)

Capybara API that knows how to wait for Angular in end to end specs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'capybara-angular'

## Usage

Use it as you would use regular Capybara API, however this time, you won't face any race conditions when working with AngularJS applications.

```ruby
include Capybara::Angular::DSL
```

## Limitations

At the moment it works with AngularJS applications initialized with `ng-app`.
